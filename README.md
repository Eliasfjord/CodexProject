# Insurance CRM

This project provides a simple CRM application for insurance agents. It includes a Node.js backend and a minimal frontend written in vanilla HTML/JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to use the CRM.

## Features

- Add new clients with name, email, and phone number.
- View a list of existing clients.
- Client data is persisted to `db.json`.

This is a foundation for future enhancements such as team management and dashboards.
