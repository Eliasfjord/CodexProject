# Insurance CRM

This project provides a simple CRM application for insurance agents. It includes a Node.js backend and a minimal frontend written in vanilla HTML/JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
 codex/fix-syntaxerror-in-server.js

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to use the CRM.

## Features

- Dashboard, calendar, leads and profile pages.
- Add new clients with name, email, and phone number from the leads page.
- View a list of existing clients.
- Client data is persisted to `db.json`.

This is a foundation for future enhancements such as team management and dashboards.
